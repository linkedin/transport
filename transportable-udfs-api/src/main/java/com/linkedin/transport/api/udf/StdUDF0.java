   * The Standard UDF framework localizes the files passed through this method and provides the localized file paths to
   * {@link StdUDF#processRequiredFiles(String[])} for further processing. Users can use the pattern "#LATEST" instead
   * of a concrete directory name in the path as a way of selecting the directory with the most recent timestamp, and
   * hence obtaining the most recent version of a file.
   * Example: 'hdfs:///data/derived/dwh/prop/testMemberId/#LATEST/testMemberId.txt'
   *
   * The arguments passed to {@link #eval()} are passed to this method as well to allow users to construct
   * required file paths from arguments passed to the UDF. Since this method is called before any rows are processed,
   * only constant UDF arguments should be used to construct the file paths. Values of non-constant arguments are not
   * deterministic, and are null for most platforms. (Constant arguments are arguments whose literal values are given
   * to the UDF as opposed to non-constant arguments that are expressions which depend on columns. For example, in the
   * query {@code SELECT my_udf('my_value', T.Col1) FROM T}, {@literal my_value} is a constant argument to the UDF and
   * its value is the same for all invocations of this UDF, while {@code T.Col1} is a non-constant argument since it is
   * an expression that depends on a table column, and hence its value changes on a per-row basis).
   *
   * @return an array of file paths to be localized at the worker nodes.
