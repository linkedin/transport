# Transport-Trino Plugin
The **TransportPlugin** class is a standard [Trino connector](https://trino.io/docs/current/develop/connectors.html) 
that provides the UDF generated by Transport on the Trino server at runtime. This framework relies on
the [dynamic function resolution SPI](https://trino.io/docs/current/release/release-395.html#spi) introduced to
Trino starting v395. 

Therefore, a Trino server with version 395 or above is required for the Transport-Trino plugin.
